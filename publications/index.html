        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        Despite the widespread use of mobile phones and tablets, hand-held portable devices have only recently been identified as a promising platform for gaze-aware applications. Estimating gaze on portable devices is challenging given their limited computational resources, low quality integrated front-facing RGB cameras, and small screens to which gaze is mapped. In this paper we present <i>EyeTab</i>, a model-based approach for binocular gaze estimation that runs entirely on an unmodified tablet. EyeTab builds on a set of established imageprocessing and computer vision algorithms, and adapts them for robust and near-realtime gaze estimation. A technical prototype evaluation with eight participants in a normal indoors office setting shows that EyeTab achieves an average gaze estimation accuracy of 6.88 degrees of visual angle at 12 frames per second.
