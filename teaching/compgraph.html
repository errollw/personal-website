        <h1>Computer graphics &amp; image processing</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Work for this course includes: </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Written exercises &ndash; covering a range of course material </li>
                <li>Practical exercises &ndash; learn the algorithms better by coding them </li>
                <li>Past exam questions &ndash; discover what is expected in the exam </li>
            </ol>
        </article>

        <h2>Submission of practical exercises </h2>
        <article>
            <p>When you complete the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/CompGraph/progenv.html">practical work</a>, you will have a Java class that <span class='mono'>implements Algorithm2D</span>so that it may work with Easel. </p>

            <p>Please name your class in the form <span class='mono'>&lt;crsid&gt;_&lt;ExerciseName&gt;</span>, e.g. the filenames for my supervision two solutions would be <span class='mono'>eww23_Bezier.java</span>and <span class='mono'>eww23_DouglasPeuker.java</span>. Email me these Java source files. </p>

            <p>Though it seems contrary to Java's object-orientated nature, the solution to each exercise is often best contained within one class only. This makes them more portable and easier to mark.</p>

        <h2>Textbook</h2>
        <article>
            <p> I recommend <i>Computer graphics: principles and practice</i> &ndash; Foley, J.D., van Dam, A., Feiner, S.K. &amp; Hughes, J.F. (1990) [FvDFH], as it covers the course's 2D rendering algorithms in detail, providing code and examples.</p>
            <p> Also, used versions of the second edition can be purchased cheaply (&lt; £5) online on <i>Ebay</i> or similar.</p>
        </article>

        <h1>Supervision work</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Please complete the following <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/CompGraph/exercises.html">supervision exercises</a> and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/t-ComputerGraphicsandImageProcessing.html">past papers</a>.</p>

            <p>General instructions for handing in work can be found <a href="\teaching#handinginwork" target='_blank'> here</a>.</p>

            <p>I strongly encourage you to do as many practical exercises as possible, as algorithms are frequently examined and there is no better way to learn them than to code them yourself!</p>
