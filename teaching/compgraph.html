          <p> Work for this course includes: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Written exercises &ndash; covering a range of course material </li>
            <li>Practical exercises &ndash; learn the algorithms better by coding them </li>
            <li>Past exam questions &ndash; discover what is expected in the exam </li>
          </ol>

          <h2> Submission of practical exercises </h2>

          <p> When you complete the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/CompGraph/progenv.html">practical work</a>, you will have a Java class that <span class='mono'>implements Algorithm2D</span> so that it may work with Easel. </p>

          <p> Please name your class in the form <span class='mono'> &lt;crsid&gt;_&lt;ExerciseName&gt;</span>, e.g. the filename for the source of my solution to practical exercise 1-4 would be named <span class='mono'>eww23_DrawCircle.java</span>. Email me these Java source files. </p>

          <p> Though it seems contrary to Java's object-orientated nature, solutions to these exercises are often best contained within one class only. This makes them more portable and easier to mark. </p>

          <h2>Textbook</h2>
          <p> I recommend <i>Computer graphics: principles and practice</i> &ndash; Foley, J.D., van Dam, A., Feiner, S.K. &amp; Hughes, J.F. (1990) [FvDFH], as it covers the course's 2D rendering algorithms in detail, providing code and examples.</p>
          <p> Also, used versions of the second edition can be purchased cheaply (&lt; £5) online on <i>Ebay</i> or similar. Though some discussion in the older version is a bit dated, the algorithms have remained the same.</p>

          <h1>Supervision work</h1>
          <p>Please complete the following <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/CompGraph/exercises.html">supervision exercises</a> and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/t-ComputerGraphicsandImageProcessing.html">past papers</a>:</p>
          <p>I strongly encourage you to do as many practical exercises as possible, as algorithms are frequently examined and there is no better way to learn them than to code them yourself!</p>
