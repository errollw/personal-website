            <p>Work for this course includes: </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Written exercises &ndash; from the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1415/CompGraph/exercises.html">course website</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/fcg3/">textbook</a> </li>
                <li>Practical exercises &ndash; learn the algorithms better by coding them </li>
                <li>Past exam questions &ndash; discover what is expected in the exam </li>
            </ol>
        </article>

        <h2>Submission of practical exercises </h2>
        <article>
            <p>The supervision exercises require you to write a simple raytracer. You can use whatever programming language or tools for this as you wish, but I suggest using some that already have <i>vector maths</i> and the ability to set pixels in an image.</p>

            <p>Therefore, I suggest that you write it in Javascript. You all should have an HTML5-compatible browser which can set pixels in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial">Canvas element</a>, and I suggest using a <a href="http://evanw.github.io/lightgl.js/docs/vector.html">library</a> for vector maths.</p>

            <p>I have packaged all you need in a <a href="raytracer_week_1.zip">.zip file</a> that contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>raytracer_week1.html</i> &ndash; open this file in a web browser to run the Javascript and render the image.</li>
                <li><i>raytracer_week1.js</i> &ndash; this is a template for writing your own ray tracer.</li>
                <li><i><a href="http://evanw.github.io/lightgl.js/docs/vector.html">vector.js</a></i> &ndash; this is a vector maths library, no need to modify it.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The main file you should modify is <i>raytracer_week1.js</i>. Please rename this to "CRSID_raytracer_week1.js" with your appropriate <a href="http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/accounts/crsid">CRSid</a> and email it to me. Beware, if you modify this filename without changing it in raytracer_week1.html, it will stop working.</p>
        </article>

        <h2>Textbook</h2>
        <aside class='three-quarter'>
            <p>I recommend acquiring a copy of <a class="p-out" data-p-out-name="Fundamentals of CG" href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/fcg3/"><i>Fundamentals of Computer Graphics</i> [FCG] &ndash; Shirley, P. &amp; Marschner, S. (2009)</a>. This is the main textbook for the course and it covers the course's concepts and algorithms in detail, providing pseudo code and examples.</p>
            <p>Some of the supervision exercises are taken from the book exercises.</p>
            <p>Check for a copy in your college or the lab library, or try to find one online.</p>

        <h1>Supervision work</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Please complete the following <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/CompGraph/exercises.html">supervision exercises</a> and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/t-ComputerGraphicsandImageProcessing.html">past papers</a>.</p>

            <p>General instructions for handing in work can be found <a href="\teaching/#handing_in_work" target='_blank'> here</a>.</p>

            <p>I strongly encourage you to do as many practical exercises as possible, as algorithms are frequently examined and there is no better way to learn them than to code them yourself! If you struggle with the code, please email me ahead of the supervision.</p>

        <h2>Supervision 1</h2>

            <article>

                <p> This supervision concerns the fundamental concepts of images and vision, simple raytracing, and shading.</p>

                <h4>Written exercises &ndash; <i>Introduction and simple rendering</i></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li> Why is it better to look at faint stars and comets slightly off-centre rather than looking directly at them? </li>
                    <li> Calculate the ultimate monitor resolution (i.e. colour pixels/inch) beyond which better resolution will be unnecessary. </li>
                    <li> Why do we use square pixels? Would hexagonal pixels be better? What about triangles? Do you see any difficulties building graphics hardware with these other two schemes?</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Written exercises &ndash; from the textbook</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li> What are the ray parameters of the intersection points between ray (1,1,1) + t(−1,−1,−1) and the sphere centered at the origin with radius 1? <i>[FCG p89]</i>
                    <li> Why do most highlights on plastic objects look white, while those on gold metal look gold? <i>[FCG p242]</i></li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Practical work</h4>

                <aside class="two-thirds">
                    <p>Write a very simple ray-tracer. This will involve ray tracing a sphere and shading it with Phong illumination. If you are able, add more objects like blocks, and perhaps shadows and reflection.</p>
                    <p>All you need in the <a href="raytracer_week_1.zip">.zip file</a>. Sample output might look like this:</p>
