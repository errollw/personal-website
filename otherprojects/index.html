        <h1>Gonville &amp; Caius May Ball</h1>
        <article>
        <p><a class='p-out' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Ball">May Balls</a> are lavish formal parties that take place at the end of each academic year in Cambridge. They are known for being some of the most spectacular and extravagant social events in the world.</p>

        <p>The <a class='p-out' href="http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/">Gonville &amp; Caius College</a> May Ball occurs every two years and attracts over a thousand guests. The ball is planned by a <i>May Ball Committee</i> who organize music, food, drink, and entertainment for the guests to enjoy from 7pm through to 5am the following morning.</p>

        <p>I have been on the committee twice &ndash; in 2012 and 2014.</p>

            <p>Our theme for 2014 was <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/a-brief-history-of-time.html">A Brief History of Time</a>. I developed websites for advertising the theme and ticketting. Additionally, I developed and deployed a mobile-based secure entry system using Android phones and QR codes &ndash; the first of its kind for a May Ball. Using this, we processed the queue of our 1,500 guests faster than ever before.</p>

            <p>We applied the theme, John Milton's poem <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost">Paradise Lost</a></i>, to the ball. We managed a large budget (£10k) and decorated the entire college, inside and out.</p>

            <p>I also designed posters and developed websites for ticketing and staffing.
            To try and engage the guests with the theme before the ball, I developed a 3D book webapp where users could explore the story, accompanied by illustrations by Gustave Doré.</p>
