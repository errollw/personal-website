        <h1>Gonville &amp; Caius May Ball</h1>
        <p><a class='p-out' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Ball">May Balls</a> are lavish formal parties that take place at the end of each academic year in Cambridge. They are known for being some of the most spectacular and extravagant social events in the world, so though they are expensive, they are extremely popular.</p>

        <p>The <a class='p-out' href="http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/">Gonville &amp; Caius College</a> May Ball is biennial, occurring every two years and attracting well over a thousand guests. The ball is planned by a <i>May Ball Committee</i> who organize music, food, drink, and entertainment for the guests to enjoy from 7pm through to 5am the following morning.</p>

        <p>I have been on the committee twice &ndash; 2011 and 2013.</p>
